ESP8266 Arduino sketch to automate irrigation, pet feeding/drinking plus ip camera control.

Disclaimer: Use this code at your own risk. I have been using it reliably for some time but there are no guarantees, especially if you make changes. Do NOT let this be the only thing in place to keep your pets alive. Please ensure you have a backup in place if something fails and a way of knowing that the backup is needed. I accept no responsibilty for any adverse outcomes that stem from the use of this code.

This entire project is covered in this video: https://youtu.be/Hz5E83ftKio

This code was originally based on a tutorial by donskytech here: // Adapted from https://github.com/donskytech/esp-projects/tree/master/esp8266-nodemcu-webserver-ajax
It has since been greatly expanded.
